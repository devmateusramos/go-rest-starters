## Introduction
The Go REST Starters project aims to provide a solid foundation for Go projects utilizing RESTful APIs, incorporating best practices and tools for efficient development. This repository serves as a collection of well-structured project starters using various tools and frameworks within the Go ecosystem.

Initially, the project focuses on integrating PostgreSQL and Redis databases, offering examples that demonstrate configuring migrations, logging, utilizing Docker for integration testing with PostgreSQL and Redis and via test containers. Additionally, it provides options for setting environment variables for local development, includes a Makefile for common tasks, and plans to expand its features in the future.

The ultimate goal is to offer a diverse range of options, including projects that utilize different HTTP frameworks and ones that solely rely on the standard library of Go. This ensures developers have a wide array of choices based on their preferences and project requirements. Initially, the project will support two to three HTTP frameworks, such as Gin, Echo, and possibly Fiber. Furthermore, it will explore the capabilities of the standard library, showcasing its power and flexibility in building robust RESTful APIs without external frameworks.

Stay tuned for updates and additional features!
